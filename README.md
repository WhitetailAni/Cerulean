# Cerulean
A simple CTA train tracker app for your menu bar. Supports macOS 11.0+.

CTA Train Tracker API and Chicago Data Portal API keys are required. Get them at:
[https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply/](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply/)
[https://data.cityofchicago.org/profile/edit/developer_settings](https://data.cityofchicago.org/profile/edit/developer_settings)

Once they are supplied, simply build and run the app.

By default the app auto-refreshes every 360 seconds. To change this interval, edit the CRRefreshInterval value to your desired interval in seconds in the Info.plist.
